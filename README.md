# Capstone2: Airbnb Bangkok Analysis
## Background
Bangkok was ranked as the most visited city in 2022–2023, attracting around 22 million tourists. When visiting Bangkok, accommodation is naturally one of the key considerations for travelers. Renting a place through Airbnb can be a preferred option for many visitors. With such a high number of tourists, there is a significant opportunity to market Airbnb listings more effectively.

Therefore, it is important for the company to gain a deeper understanding of the distribution and popularity of its listings to maximize these opportunities. In this project, I perform exploratory data analysis on several factors related to Airbnb listings in Bangkok. The goal is to provide insights and recommendations that can help stakeholders optimize the potential within the market.

## Questions to answer
1. How are Airbnb listings distributed across the city of Bangkok?
2. Which districts are the most popular?
3. How many Airbnb listings are there based on the year of the last review?
4. What types of Airbnb rooms in Bangkok are the most preferred by users?

## Conclusions
1. **Airbnb Presence Across Bangkok**
Airbnb listings are available in all districts of Bangkok, although their distribution is not evenly spread across the city.

2. **Central Districts Dominate the Market**
The majority of Airbnb listings are concentrated in central Bangkok, particularly in the Vadhana and Khlong Toei districts. These areas account for the highest number of listings, reflecting their popularity among both hosts and travelers.

3. **Popularity Driven by Location Advantages**
When viewed through the number of reviews, Vadhana and Khlong Toei also stand out as the most popular districts. This trend can be attributed to their strategic central locations, offering many attractions such as luxury restaurants and hotels, shopping malls, and excellent public transportation access via the MRT.

4. **Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic**
A noticeable decline in Airbnb activity occurred between 2020 and 2021, likely due to the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, by mid-2022, activity began to rise again — suggesting a gradual recovery in the tourism sector as travel restrictions eased.

5. **Room Type Preferences**
The “Entire home/apt” room type is the most widely available across Bangkok. It also dominates in terms of the number of reviews, showing consistent popularity among guests across almost all districts.

6. **Unique Trend in Bang Rak District**
In the Bang Rak district, there are more listings categorized as “Private room” compared to other types. However, “Entire home/apt” listings still receive more reviews, indicating that while private rooms are more common, travelers still prefer full and private accommodations.

## Recommendations
1. Since most Airbnb listings are concentrated in the central areas of Bangkok, marketing efforts can be strengthened in these districts. Focus on showcasing the attractions of these areas — for example, highlighting popular restaurants and convenient transportation access.
2. Establish partnerships with nearby businesses, such as restaurants, tourist attractions, and public transportation services. For instance, offer discount promotions for meals or reduced MRT ticket prices to attract more guests.
3. Focus marketing strategies on the “Entire home/apt” room type, as it is both the most common and the most popular type among users.
4. Introduce a point reward program for users who leave reviews on listings. This can help increase the number of reviews and improve listing visibility.
5. Collaborate with the Thai government to take advantage of tourism subsidy programs introduced after the pandemic.
